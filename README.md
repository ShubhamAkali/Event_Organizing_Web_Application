# Event_Organizing_Web_Application
Developed an Event Organizing Web Application that facilitates seamless event management for admins, customers, and vendors. The front end is built using ReactJS, with Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, and TailwindCSS for styling. The back end is powered by Spring Boot, with secure authentication and authorization implemented using Spring Security with JWT tokens, and MySQL is used as the Database Management System. To ensure the reliability of the application, I utilized JUnit for unit testing and Postman for integration testing. This project exemplifies a full-stack development approach, delivering a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform
